      <description>Goals The aim from this tutorial is to learn to install and setup Archlinux.&#xA;Why Arch? Well, Other than it being my daily driver therefore I&amp;rsquo;m more familiar and confortable setting it up, I chose Arch because it gives you full control on the programs and utilities you can install, witch makes it easy to showcase and learn a lot of things about the way Gnu/Linux operates.&#xA;Another goal is to showcase and introduce you to the programs I run on my computer that could replace a lot of proprietary garbage a lot of us got used to.</description>
