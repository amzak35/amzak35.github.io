      <description>Vi/Vim/Nvim in the works This is not going to be a full on tutorial on these programs, but only a showcase of the logic, method and usefulness of these programs.
The aim here is to demystify and debunk the myths surrounding them.
Happy reading.
What is Vi Vi is a terminal based text editor, a very powerful one, with a somewhat steep learning curve. Lot of people (Even some technical savvy ones) are afraid of it, they find it complicated to use and non user friendly, when in reality, all it takes is the willingness to try it without the prejudice surrounding it.</description>

      <description>Goals The aim from this tutorial is to learn to install and setup Archlinux.
Why Arch? Well, Other than it being my daily driver therefore I&amp;rsquo;m more familiar and confortable setting it up, I chose Arch because it gives you full control on the programs and utilities you can install, witch makes it easy to showcase and learn a lot of things about the way Gnu/Linux operates.
Another goal is to showcase and introduce you to the programs I run on my computer that could replace a lot of proprietary garbage a lot of us got used to.</description>
